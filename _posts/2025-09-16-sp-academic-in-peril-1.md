Introduction

Starfellow (and I assure you, we are on a first name basis) is a man of great wisdom, wit, and worldliness. He hired me as a biographer about five years ago, hoping to get a jump on the whole “media personality endeavor” when he was sure his latest invention would lead to a Nobel prize. Unfortunately, he was unable to secure a nomination that year, though I am sure one will be coming soon… otherwise, this work may not be the best use of my time. Certainly, I do often question its relevance in the wake of recent events, colorful characters, and the drenching rain that is not serving as the most reassuring symbol. But perhaps, in spite of these shortcomings, you may find this story entertaining. So, without further delay, I present to you the soft launch of my latest project: Starfellow Pike! Work in Progress?

Starfellow Pike: Academic in Peril
Part One: A Family Matter  

Our story begins on an ordinary day in mid-May where the afternoon is crisp and windy. Starfellow Pike was pacing back and forth in the living room (or perhaps more accurately, the occasionally inhabited area. Really, a generous description of the decor would be minimalist, as though it had been owned for a number of decades, it had a stubborn refusal of character similar to an empty box or a raw potato). Starfellow was pacing because he had not received a call from his mother this weekend. Silence from his mother generally meant not that a terrible accident had befallen her, but rather that she was preoccupied by scheming, and this scheming could undoubtedly lead to terrible accidents befalling others. He was, as he always is, quite busy with research, and did not have much energy to be schemed at or otherwise imposed upon by his overbearing family. 

Starfellow’s work life  is difficult to separate from his personality, and tends to be all consuming. For instance, Starfellow is in fact not a given name, but a title for one who has passed the standardized wizarding examinations. However, in Starfellow’s town & time, a standardized magic education was generally difficult enough to come by that possession of one was seen as enough of a commodity to constitute a personality trait. After returning home from his decade of studies with an unnecessarily large diploma and an unnecessarily complicated vocabulary, most people had forgotten his first name, so he was known then on by his academic title. (Though he seems to prefer things this way). Pike is his family name (which he never cared for, but was “nonetheless prolific enough to stick around”). In keeping with Starfellow’s wish to not “overemphasize the impact of coincidentally bound parties” on his outcomes, I will keep the details regarding the Pike family brief. (I’m sure they will be introduced properly soon enough). 

Starfellow  was likely born between fifty and sixty years ago to parents Confundidus Pike & Marianne Thromble. Marianne, mother of steel, is by all accounts a woman with remarkable wit, practicality, and indignation. She had the incredible fortune of falling in love with her perfect match, but also the incredible misfortune that this perfect match was lacking in most of the traits necessary for a stable life. Marianne was of “dubious” heritage, but Confundidus came from a quite prominent family in the South. Despite having  a knack for inventing, Confundidus’s most lasting achievement seems to be a life spent disgracing the good Pike name, first by losing ludicrous amounts of money on his travels, then by having four children with a woman of lesser status, and finally, to top it all off, dying a few years later, leaving a bereaved family in need of support. This support was begrudgingly provided by the Pike estate to Starfellow’s mother in the form of monthly payments. With her own income as a travel agent (more on that later), her family was able to live a fairly comfortable life. 

Our humble protagonist recalls his upbringing as “casual, benign, and largely inconsequential.” In a household with three exuberant sisters, Starfellow’s reserved personality made it easy to stay out of the spotlight and live life with a decent amount of freedom. Though Starfellow won’t disclose exact details (“foggy memory”) it seems that this mainly consisted of throwing rocks into streams, and similar pensive boyish activities. It was his mother who initially suggested that Starfellow follow in the footsteps of his sisters by enrolling in a magic school at the age of fourteen. This was not so much because she felt the education system would give him a leg up in the world, but more because she had a bit of a fascination with the occult and a resentment of the strict safeguarding of these so-called “divine abilities.” In her mind, not much harm could come from having a slightly magical family that could perhaps do fun tricks, tidy up easier, and stick it to the institution as necessary. She did not hide her disappointment when all her children failed to impress her with “magic of real use” and instead largely used their newfound education for the pursuit of abstract academic principles. If Starfellow feels sadness regarding this lack of validation, he does not show it. In fact, at the moment, he would much rather have the grating rhythm of his mother’s chastising than the empty living room, now draped with silence and an eerie uncertainty. 

Luckily for Starfellow (and for me, as I begin to grow tired of exposition), the quiet home was interrupted by four taps at the door. (You can tell a lot about a person by the way they knock on a door. If we go by the latest scientific publication on the matter- J. Nordeau’s “A study on human-threshold interaction and ecological consequences”- four knocks like these, medium volume, in lazy succession, indicates the knocker is likely bored, irritated, or hungry for an egg sandwich. It just so happens that our knocker was definitely all three.) Starfellow opened the door, glancing cautiously at the ominous visitor. In front of him stood a short woman with spiky jewelry, an exceedingly large umbrella, and an unamused expression. Perhaps, reasoned Starfellow, she was a newspaper delivery person. A new one most likely, given her youthfulness and out of place attire. As Starfellow did not subscribe to any newspapers (too much irrelevant information) he decided to help out this improbable creature with a polite rejection, opting to make no comment and simply shut his door.  However, as he began to swing the door, the woman noticed his intent and jammed the tip of her oversized umbrella in the doorframe, preventing the door from closing, and rendering Starfellow more than a little confused. 

“Um,” she spoke, metal rings glinting almost viciously in the sunlight. “Are you Starfellow Pike?”

“Well, yes?” responded Starfellow, cautious of this strange delivery girl.

“I’m your niece?” she said, squinting at him. “Remember?”

Starfellow squinted back at her. Did he have a niece? That certainly does seem like the kind of stunt one of his sisters would come up with. He vaguely recollected sending childish birthday cards a few times, but the woman in front of him seemed closer to seventeen or eighteen. That wouldn’t do. Starfellow had a minor aversion to young people. As he mused to me often, “why bother with those whose minds are not fully formed?”

“Here,” said the woman, clearly sensing Starfellow very much did not remember her, and placed a crinkled envelope into Starfellow’s hand. “It’s from grandma,” she explained, crossing over the threshold. Then, making eye contact with me, perhaps with the assumption I was some sort of house staff, “I’m hungry,” she declared. Not wanting to disappoint, I began, in a daze, to make a sandwich. 

Meanwhile, Starfellow turned the letter around in his hands, somewhat shell-shocked. The letter was unmistakably in his mother’s handwriting, and when opened, went something like this:

“My dear son, …”
(Starfellow questioned if his mother even remembered his given name)

“Here is your niece, Raymonda. Her mother (your sister Arianna) was getting tired of her so she went to live with me. However, she was a terrible nuisance in the garden, so it has been decided she will now live with you as an apprentice. Good luck.

More importantly, I have my eye on a new plant for the garden. It is very rare, but I believe it tends to pop up in your area. It’s called a scriggly shrubbery. As you can imagine, it's like a normal fern, but a tad scrigglier. Looks something like this:

Please send via post as soon as possible. The garden show is coming up, and I cannot lose face again after last year's debacle.

Mother”
(Marianne was not one for light conversation.)

Trying to remain rational through this upheaval, Starfellow considered the potential positives of having an apprentice. It would be nice to get extra help cleaning his work space, but also that would mean someone sharing his materials, and potentially even his credit. Not to mention, the apprentice in question most definitely did not have the mental capability or finesse necessary to manage his studies. That much was clear as Starfellow watched the girl stare blankly at her egg sandwich, one foot on a chair, and her cup of water resting precariously on his latest writing draft. It seemed at this point, his best option was to minimize damage, and perhaps with the help of some boring tasks, Raymonda could disappear just as suddenly as she arrived.

As I soon learned, the girl did not have much conviction to stick around anyway. Raymonda Austen Zeitan “Jeanie” Pike is actually twenty two years old, just very youthful looking. She claims her secret is zero sun exposure, a protein-rich diet, and an unshakable spiritual connection to “tevl lok” (as far as I can figure, some new age mother nature reference). Due to being raised solely by her mother, Jeanie ended up picking up a lot of willpower, skepticism, and arrogance. As a result of these similarities, their mother- daughter relationship became wholly incompatible. After making it through about 95% of her agronomy undergraduate degree, Jeanie dropped out of school entirely due to a severe case of incapacitating boredom. (A real medical condition, Jeanie assures me, and very difficult on the spleen.) A month into her prescribed European travels, Jeanie found her new life calling in the form of a boy named Leno, an American surfer with extremely toned abs and an extraordinarily smooth brain. For a time, it seemed they were a match made in heaven (a bit too reliant on spiritual intervention to work on Earth). But, after Jeanie ran out of travel money and Leno met a girl from Italy, their relationship had to come to a “mutual” ending. It was then that Jeanie found herself with her mother, shifted to her grandmother, and finally braving ten hours of public transit to make it to the secluded cottage of her estranged, eccentric uncle. Apart from the food, Jeanie was not impressed.

Our story continues…
