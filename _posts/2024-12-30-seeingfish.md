Lately I have been seeing fish
<br>I watch them dance on the pavement
<br>And fall in the rain
<br>And leap over my textbooks and through my hair and in my sheets

<br>I tried to tell them that this is no land for fish
<br>No ocean here for millions of years
<br>No place for them in the flourescent hallways or the barren winter fields or the dull still of my room in the early hours of the morning
<br>I don't think they understand

<br>And so when I am too tired for reasoning, I watch them:
<br>With great wings and shifting scales, and tails that float, weightless
<br>Less like fish and more like angels, always moving, beautiful, unassuming:
<br>Lost on me

<br>And now and then I draw them,
<br>Even though I am no artist
<br>And now and then I try to dance with them in the waves,
<br>Even though I see no waves

<br>I can't remember when they got here
<br>When they slipped through to the muddled part of my mind
<br>I ask them if they have plans to stay
<br>They answer in time, in silence

<br>And so I watch them sway in the light and sway in the dark
<br>I dream in fish and waves and quiet ocean depths
<br>I wonder if they've traveled far
<br>I wonder if they're coming home
