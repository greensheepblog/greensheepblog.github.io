Punctuation has the ability to add to your unique style as much as any variation in word choice, literary devices, or vaguely philosophical musings. Though the use of punctuation is generally taught to be strict and unwavering, modern writers are increasingly pushing back against conventional boundaries in both creative and technical writing. By incorporating a more liberal use of punctuation into their works, authors can convey points and subtleties traditional grammar fails to address (or at the very least stand out from the pack with a bit of design flair.) Below is a compiled guide of some of my favorite unconventional punctuation, with examples of usage as necessary.

STARS

Commonly used in footnotes and censorship, stars are some of the most aesthetically beautiful elements that can be added to text. Whether an asterisk (*) or a unicode symbol (★), stars are extremely versatile in both styling and application. Some key uses include:

Drawing attention to points: Just as stars in the sky may guide weary travelers, so too can your stars indicate to the reader a detail of significance they might otherwise overlook.

Adding controlled space: Due to their stylistic beauty, stars also provide a way to separate ideas, paragraphs, or movements in a more fun way than conventional grammar allows. It should be noted that stars often work best in groups of odd numbers, especially in an equivalent amount to the number of points on each unit. (Numerical harmony being as it is!)

Signifying universal or otherworldly influence: Sometimes, you just want your readers to feel that your piece is of immense importance. Stars have been a subject of fascination & mysticism for humans across the millenia, often depicted in religious texts such as the Bible and Quran. Their inclusion in works can sometimes be a subconscious calling to readers, adding a sense of foreboding, or destiny to an otherwise bland or preachy piece.

BREAKING THE 4TH WALL

Three lines drawn vertically and grouped together in this symbol (|||) are representative of three walls in a room *and a nonexistent, broken 4th wall*. As the name indicates, this symbol can be used in situations where a character breaks the established boundaries of the story, and speaks directly to the audience. More radical writers are also beginning to use this symbol as means of showing a disjunction in time- seemingly alluding to notions of the 4th dimension. 

Proponents of the symbol feel that it is useful in inviting the reader to engage with the text on a more personal level, thus involving them further with the work. Skeptics, however, point out that writers have historically been able to speak directly to audiences or have omniscient narrators without need for specific, standardized punctuation. The inclusion of such punctuation only limits creativity and minimizes the technical skill needed for tactful writing. The 4th wall symbol is still relatively experimental, but the debate around its usage is expected to grow as modern literary pieces further push the boundaries between author, text, & reader.

AMPERSANDS

This symbol is quite non-metaphorically, a classic. The ancient latin “et” was once used commonly as the 27th letter of the alphabet. Unfortunately, due to the unfettered growth of capitalism, the ampersand fell out of fashion in the mid 20th century when typewriter manufacturers felt including it as its own key was simply “not enough bang for its buck.” (Interestingly enough, the letter C was also targeted in this time period. Unlike the ampersand however, C survived cost cutting measures largely due to its presence in the word America. The proposed alternate spelling, Amerika, was shown in focus group studies to be just too Germanic for most consumers to go for.)

After over half a century spent in exile from mainstream writing, in recent years ampersands have entered a new age of prominence. Spurred largely by the growing popularity of blogs and advancements in home goods, most people today are familiar with this unique symbol. Modern orthographic studies are also beginning to reveal why this symbol has such a timeless appeal. According to a research collaboration between the University of Minnesota, and the Goethe Institute, the ampersand may be a long lost cousin of the modern infinity sign (∞). The similar shape of the two symbols could be an example of homologous orthographic structures, linking both to an undiscovered rune of the ancient world. This connection could mean that similarly to the infinity sign, the ampersand has pictorial significance regarding the eternal unknown of the universe. It is from this vast unknown, that the ampersand invites readers to consider possible additions to the context with which they are already familiar. 

Aside from the philosophical explanation, the ampersand holds a special place in the hearts of many simply because it is remarkably pleasing to write & read! At the present time ampersands are not widely considered an appropriate element in professional or technical writing. However, I would urge the reader not to be discouraged by this arbitrary gatekeeping. Ampersands are beautiful, useful, & surprisingly versatile. 

They can be used as a simple substitution:

	I LOVE TO HAVE CANDY & PASTRIES ON THE WEEKEND.

An indication of further (but possibly unknowable) information:

	PLEASE PACK YOUR RAIN JACKET, LANYARD, RING, & …

Or as a lovely bit of decoration & emphasis:

	&&& BE HAPPY &&&

As you can see from the examples above, including this amazing character is definitely worth any slip ups in perceived professionality! In fact, the symbol is increasingly being used by people around the world, most notably gaining traction in radical environmental groups due to its efficient, conservational nature. Whether you are synced into its universal meaning or not, the ampersand is undoubtedly a fun & exciting way to spice up your writing that will most certainly be making a comeback. 

UPSIDE-DOWN QUESTION MARKS

The upside-down question mark ( ¿ ) is already a part of formal punctuation in Spanish, used to start a question. Additionally, English speakers who are in the habit of questioning may also find this a useful symbol. The use of an upside down question mark can signify a type of vague or second level questioning, almost as if the writer is questioning the act of questioning itself. (Because who can have too many questions?) Please be aware– this symbol is not a demonstration of self doubt, but rather an indicator of awareness to a complex situation or the author’s innate desire to question. The upside-down question mark has a more nuanced touch than many other punctuation marks, and is more adaptable to the specific tone of the author.

SPECIAL MENTIONS:

HEARTS- ♥ ♥ ♥
Hearts are an adorable way to contribute to your writing style, especially in situations in which you want your reader to have a strong emotional boost of positivity in their life. Too often do authors take pride in their unintelligible contemplation and grammatically fanatical punctuation at the expense of the reader. Instead of adding a semicolon to alienate your readers, add a heart to make them feel loved!
		X IT’S COOL TO USE PUNCTUATION; IT MAKES WRITING LEGIBLE. 
		✓ IT’S COOL TO USE PUNCTUATION ♥ IT MAKES WRITING FUN!    
	

UPSIDE-DOWN EXCLAMATION POINTS- ¡¡¡¡¡
Yes, the upside-down punctuation returns. Unlike the upside down question marks, exclamation points don’t have to indicate any hesitation whatsoever. In fact, they are a symbol of great joy- and almost bewildered awe! Do not be afraid to overuse them.

AMPERSAND-UPSIDE DOWN QUESTION MARK
Well, the name is still being workshopped for this one, but at least it’s pretty self-explanatory. Pictured below, this punctuation is still in its infancy, and has yet to make the big break to keyboards or unicode directories. 
 
FLOWERS- ⚘ ⁕ ⚘
One of my personal favorites, especially in handwriting, flowers are pretty, whimsical, and magical. Flowers are the sort of loose creative touch that can add whatever you want, and mean whatever you like them to mean. As a writer, you ultimately have control over your life and choices, and punctuation is no different. Change your writing tools as you see fit, don’t let conventionality get you down :)
