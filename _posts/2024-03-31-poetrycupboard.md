<br>Hello! I have recently begun experimenting with poems- though it's very slow going. I thought I'd share some here from the past few months. Definitely super scary, but it's better than them gathering dust :/

<br>*From early 2024:*

<br>**Crooked Preacher:**
<br>Two fingers twisting the cigarette
<br>The smoke curls around me, softly
<br>He is a crooked preacher
<br>And I inhale his sermons, greedy 

<br>My mouth tastes of ink
<br>My fingers twitch with that familiar yearning
<br>His breath smells of secrets
<br>And I am starving for a story

<br>Feed me with the stolen truths
<br>Tell me you are doomed for the cross
<br>My tongue will hold the sacred words
<br>That lick up your body, kindling

<br>Like me, he is a performer
<br>Content to burn, so I can watch
<br>I dance in his sweet smoke
<br>While he is singed into immortality

<br>**Bechdel Test:**
<br>We’re sitting on the park bench
<br>Feeling outgrown of our summer clothes
<br>Tan skin brushing in the sun
<br>Ice cream lips damp in the heat

<br>My legs are dark, unshaven:
<br>Mom hates the patriarchy
<br>Hers are the same:
<br>She’s not allowed the razor right now

<br>She asks if I would trade her for anything
<br>Of course not, I love her
<br>It’s hard to imagine
<br>We can’t be enough

<br>We lay on our backs now
<br>Spread out like flowers in the sun
<br>We hold our hands together
<br>Dream of boys to make us whole

<br>*From October 2024...*

<br>**Almost Friends**
<br>I wish you would let me take care of your plant.
<br>I would put it by my desk, right in the sunlight
<br>I would water it every week
<br>I would sing to it if it got sad
<br>And if it was hungry, I would buy special plant food
<br>And if there were bugs, I would chase them away
<br>And if there was a storm, I would carry it to safety
<br>And if anyone tried to steal it, I would kill them.

<br>So just let me know next time you go away
<br>It’s no problem, I’ll look after it
<br>Trust me, please.

<br><b>Rhymes in Orange</b>
<br>satsumas, tangerines
<br>mandarins, or clementines
<br>a pack of 8 
<br>for just 1.35

<br><br>That’s 7 for me
<br>And 1 for you
<br>Or maybe 2
<br>(if you visit my room)

<br><br>They’re really quite nice
<br>Except if you’re sick
<br>Then I’ll gift tea
<br>What else can I give?

<br><br>So we trade the small things
<br>We count in colors
<br>It’s the smell on your hands
<br>The rinds in the trash

<br><br>Satsumas, tangerines
<br>mandarins, or clementines
<br>I don’t know their name
<br>You just learned mine
<br>But would you like an orange?

<br>**October 19th/Night Slipping**
<br>It was night in the room
<br>The darkness was gooey, so that when I stepped
<br>I slipped
<br>And I fell to the floor
<br>The floor is cool on my cheek
<br>And from the floor the room is blurry, so that when I looked up
<br>I slipped
<br>And I was falling again
<br>Below the floor is damp and cold on my fingers
<br>And below the floor it’s spinning, so that when I moved
<br>I slipped:
<br>And now I’m up through the floorboards
<br>Up through the ceiling
<br>Out the door
<br>Onto the ice where it’s colder still and breaking
<br>I have too many legs, and my feet are numb
<br>So that when I stand
<br>I’m slipping
<br>I tried to focus
<br>And I tried to focus
<br>I try to focus.

<br>*February 2025...*

<br>**Bright Lights**
<br>On nights like these, the sky is clear.
<br>I remember constellations, galaxies,
<br>How we brushed each other with stars.
<br>The sky isn’t the same now, is it?

<br>On nights like these, I clear my mind
<br>I watch one light, fade to surreal
<br>I wonder if you’re holding on still
<br>If I could reach, with cold fingertips,
<br>Brush the bare soles of your feet
<br>Put things back to how they should be

<br>Things are falling down now, quickly
<br>Trails of red and white,
<br>Burning brush of men and metal
<br>Don’t get confused as to what’s real now
<br>Just come down, slowly
<br>I don't think it's our sky anymore.
