Hello! I have recently begun experimenting with poems- though it's very slow going. I thought I'd share some here from the past few months. Definitely super scary, but it's better than them gathering dust :/

*From early 2024:*

**Crooked Preacher:**
Two fingers twisting the cigarette
The smoke curls around me, softly
He is a crooked preacher
And I inhale his sermons, greedy 

My mouth tastes of ink
My fingers twitch with that familiar yearning
His breath smells of secrets
And I am starving for a story

Feed me with the stolen truths
Tell me you are doomed for the cross
My tongue will hold the sacred words
That lick up your body, kindling

Like me, he is a performer
Content to burn, so I can watch
I dance in his sweet smoke
While he is singed into immortality

**Bechdel Test:**
We’re sitting on the park bench
Feeling outgrown of our summer clothes
Tan skin brushing in the sun
Ice cream lips damp in the heat

My legs are dark, unshaven:
Mom hates the patriarchy
Hers are the same:
She’s not allowed the razor right now

She asks if I would trade her for anything
Of course not, I love her
It’s hard to imagine
We can’t be enough

We lay on our backs now
Spread out like flowers in the sun
We hold our hands together
Dream of boys to make us whole
