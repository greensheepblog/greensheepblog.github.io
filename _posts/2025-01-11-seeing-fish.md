title: "Lately, I have been seeing fish..."

Lately I have been seeing fish
I watch them dance on the pavement
And fall in the rain
And leap over my textbooks and through my hair and in my sheets

<br>I tried to tell them that this is no land for fish
No ocean here for millions of years
No place for them in the flourescent hallways or the baren winter fields or the dull still of my room in the early hours of the morning
I don't think they understand

<br>And so when I am too tired for reasoning, I watch them
With great wings and shifting scales, and tails that float, weightless
Less like fish and more like angels, always moving, beautiful, unassuming:
Lost on me

<br>And now and then I draw them,
Even though I am no artist
And now and then I try to dance with them in the waves,
Even though I see no waves

<br>I can't remember whn they got here
When they slipped through to the muddled part of my mind
I ask them if they have plans to stay
They answer in time, in silence

<br>And so I watch them sway in the light and sway in the dark
I dream in fish and waves and quiet ocean depths
I wonder if they've traveled far
I wonder if they're coming home
